# BIKEBUDDY
The ‘Bike Buddy’ also attempts to make the cyclist predictable to other cyclists and motorists by giving the cyclist the capability of signalling his/her intended direction, as well as signalling his/her presence when visibility is low through the use of a tail light that turns on when it becomes dark.
